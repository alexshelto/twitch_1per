## How it works
Twitch 1per is a web application designed for twitch streamers to be able to filter their chat.
It allows the streamer to filter messages by a prefix, while also only allowing 1 entry per username to appear on the feed. 
This allows streamers to create questionnaires or other things filtering chat for what they are looking for while preventing a singular user
to hog the entire feed.
